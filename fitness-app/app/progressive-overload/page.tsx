              <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during exercise training. It's
                the fundamental principle behind getting stronger, building muscle, and improving fitness.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-600">
                Without progressive overload, your body has no reason to adapt and improve. By consistently challenging
                your muscles with increased demands, you force them to respond by getting stronger and larger.

                While there are many ways to implement progressive overload, one of the most effective strategies, especially for beginners and intermediates, is to prioritize increasing intensity rather than simply adding more sets or workout time. This means aiming to lift heavier weights or perform more reps each week, rather than stacking on volume.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                Training with low volume and high intensity (e.g., 2 sets of 4â€“8 reps per exercise) allows your body to recover more effectively while still signaling strong adaptation. Once you're confident in your form, focus on pushing those sets close to failure with excellent technique. This minimalist approach can build strength efficiently without burning you out.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Plateauing is a normal part of training and often a sign of accumulated fatigue. If you find your progress stalling, consider taking a deload week (a lighter training week) or switching up your exercises to give your body a new stimulus and allow recovery to catch up.

            <CollapsibleTip title="The History of Progressive Overload">
              <p>
                The concept of progressive overload dates back to ancient Greece. The wrestler Milo of Croton reportedly
                carried a growing calf on his shoulders every day until it became a full-grown bull, demonstrating the
                principle of gradually increasing resistance.

            <CollapsibleTip title="Beginners Progress Faster">
              <p>
                Beginners can make progress much faster than experienced lifters. This is known as "newbie gains" and
                occurs because untrained muscles are highly responsive to new stimuli. Beginners can often increase
                weight or reps every workout for several months!
              </p>
            </CollapsibleTip>

            <CollapsibleTip title="Progressive Overload Isn't Just for Strength">
              <p>
                While often associated with weightlifting, progressive overload applies to all forms of exercise.
                Runners can gradually increase distance or pace, swimmers can add laps or reduce rest times, and yoga
                practitioners can progress to more challenging poses.
              </p>
            </CollapsibleTip>

            <CollapsibleTip title="Recovery is Essential">
              <p>
                Progressive overload only works if you allow your body to recover between workouts. Without adequate
                recovery (including sleep, nutrition, and rest days), you won't adapt properly to the increased demands
                and may even regress in performance.
